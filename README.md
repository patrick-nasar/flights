# Flights
This is a **learning project** aimed at practicing and exploring the **Angular** framework. The website is a simple flight booking platform that allows users to search for flights, and view available flights using **fake data**. It also includes basic frontend design with **Tailwind CSS** and unit testing implemented with **Jest**.

The project is **deployed on GitHub Pages** and can be accessed [here](https://patrick-nasar.github.io/flights/).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.1.

## Features
+ **View Flights**: A list of available flights is shown based on search queries (data is fake).
+ **Search Flights**: Users can search for available flights using filters like departure and destination.
+ **Responsive Design**: Optimised for both desktop and mobile with Tailwind CSS.

## Technologies Used
+ **Angular**: Frontend framework used for building the single-page application.
+ **TypeScript**: Used as the main programming language for Angular development.
